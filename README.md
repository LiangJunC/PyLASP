# PyLASP

**PyLASP** is a Python reimplementation of the LAMOST Stellar Parameter Pipeline (LASP), supporting CPU-based Levenberg-Marquardt optimization and GPU-accelerated Adam optimization for large-scale stellar parameter inference.

## Description

This repository contains the LASP-CurveFit and LASP-Adam-GPU modules, which support efficient, scalable, and cross-survey stellar atmospheric parameter estimation from low-resolution spectra.

## Availability

🛠️ The code and DESI-based results will be made publicly available **after the corresponding paper is accepted for publication**.
